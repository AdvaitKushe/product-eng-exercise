# Overview

The purpose of this application is to surface product feedback about Clarity to the team and allow us to explore the data based on different filters.

The data exists in our "database" (`api/data.json`) and is surfaced in a data table via our web application:

This is helpful to view all of our data at once, but falls short when trying to view feedback from a particular customer, only view high priority feedback, etc.

The goal of this exercise is to build a filter menu similar to Linear's:
